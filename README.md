## üí≠ The motivation

But wait, aren't there a lot of Discord integration plugins already? So why create another one?

Well, here's the thing: the existing plugins that offer Rich Presence support have either been left unmaintained
or don't provide a good enough experience that I was happy with. That's why I decided to make this plugin,
which gives the user the freedom to customize almost everything while ensuring a premium and polished feel.

## üì• Installation

The recommended way to install this plugin is through the JetBrains Marketplace,
but there are alternative ways. You can also download a distribution of the plugin in the
[release page](https://github.com/pandier/intellij-discord-rp/releases) or a build
available under every commit through GitHub actions (these builds aren't signed).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

The settings menu can be opened in **Settings -> Tools -> Discord Rich Presence**, where you can customize your Rich Presence.
Settings are split into two display modes: **Project** and **File**. The File display mode is shown
when the user is editing a file. Otherwise, the Project mode is displayed.
We use variables for showing information in text fields, here's a list of them:

| Variable          | File mode | Project mode | Value                                   |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `{app_name}`      | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ            | Name of the IDE                         |
| `{app_full_name}` | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ            | Name and version of the IDE             |
| `{project_name}`  | ‚úÖ         | ‚úÖ            | Name of the project                     |
| `{file_name}`     | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå            | Name of the current file                |
| `{file_path}`     | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå            | Path to the current file                |
| `{file_type}`     | ‚úÖ         | ‚ùå            | The determined type of the current file |
